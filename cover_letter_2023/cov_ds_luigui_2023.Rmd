My name is Luigui, and I am writing to apply for this Clinical Laboratory Scientist, Data Review because I believe my educational background and work experience make me a qualified candidate for this position at Millennium Health.

I would describe my background as Data Science and Data Analytics. For almost four years, I worked at the Institute of Biotechnology as a Data Scientist to get novel information from biological data. And now, I want to apply my skills to this industry, and I consider would be a good fit in your company. 

Having studied the job description, I am confident I have all the skills, qualities, and qualifications needed to excel in the role. Additionally, I am a fast learner and could quickly adapt to your company. I possess excellent problem-solving capabilities and can manage a significant workload or several projects from different areas without losing track of each of them.

I attached my CV and personal webpage, where you can see my portfolio and publications: https://luiguigallardo.github.io/web_page/

I’m thrilled at the opportunity to use my experiences to fuel data-driven decisions at Millennium Health, and I’m keen to continue developing my skill set on the job. I am available for a call or in-person meeting to discuss how I can help Millennium Health to obtain meaningful information through data.
