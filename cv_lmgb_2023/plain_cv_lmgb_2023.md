Dear Recruiter,

My name is Luigui, and I am writing to apply for this Discovery Bioinformatics position because I consider my educational background and work experience that make me a qualified candidate for this position. I would describe my background as Bioinformatics and Data Science. For almost four years, I worked at the Institute of Biotechnology (UNAM) as a Bioinformatician to get novel information from biological data. In recent years, I participated in different projects using modern Genomic technologies (NGS) to obtain novel information that culminated in high-impact peer-reviewed scientific publications listed on my website.

Having studied the job description, I am confident I have all the skills, qualities, and qualifications needed to excel in the role. Additionally, I am a fast learner and could quickly adapt to your workflows. I possess excellent problem-solving capabilities and can manage a significant workload or several projects from different areas without losing track of each of them.

I attached my CV and personal webpage, where you can see my portfolio and publications: https://luiguigallardo.github.io/web_page/

I’m thrilled at the opportunity to use my experiences to participate in frontier research at VALIA, and I’m keen to continue developing my skill set with you. I am available for a call or in-person meeting to discuss how I can help you to obtain meaningful information through bioinformatics data.

I appreciate your consideration,

Luigui Gallardo-Becerra
