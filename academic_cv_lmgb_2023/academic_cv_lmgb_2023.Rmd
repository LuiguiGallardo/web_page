# About me
 * In recent years, I participated in different projects using modern Genomic technologies (NGS), Data Analysis, and Data Science, to obtain novel information that culminated in high-impact peer-reviewed scientific publications. Now I am looking for Software Developer roles to extend and apply my skills.

# Experience

```

I was part of different research projects, from the beginning obtaining or creating the raw data to the final report or publication. The tasks that I carried out includes the following:

* Management of research projects: participated in the creation of main and secondary objectives and research questions from different projects to obtain novel biological information useful for the scientific community
* Server management (HPC): managed the Laboratory's server, installed Linux operative systems and specific software/packages, avoided server slowdowns, and built secure server environments
* Creation of pipelines: created pipelines to avoid repetitive workflows and make reproducible analysis using bash, Python, and Snakemake
* Software development: developed several software tools to solve and achieve specific goals using bash, Python, Perl, and R
* Creation of plots: using R, Rstudio, Jupyter Notebooks, Excel, Graphpad, and Tableau
* Maintenance of version control (CI/CD): creation and maintenance of GitHub repositories and their continuous version control 
* Creation of reports/publications: using Markdown and Word, I delivered weekly and biannual reports to the members of the Laboratory. Also, I co-authored peer-reviewed publications that are highly cited in their respective areas
* Presentations to the general public and academic events: participated in scientific dissemination, specialized seminars, and congresses

I was an independent contractor and participated in several projects that included Data Sourcing and Annotation for different Appen clients (browsers, social networks, etc.). The tasks I performed were the following:

* Data collection and Preprocessing: obtention of raw data and preprocessing before passing it to the final client or the Machine Learning Department
* Creation of weekly deliverables: for the final client or project manager
* Content translation: from Spanish to English or English to Spanish

```

I participated in the creation of a web application. The tasks that I carried out included:

* Creation of web app: using ASP.NET Core (C#) and Angular (JavaScript, HTML, and CSS), I created an API to save patients' records and images.

I participated in the research project "Microbiome of Pacific whiteleg shrimp reveals differential bacterial community composition between Wild, Aquacultured and AHPND/EMS outbreak conditions". The tasks that I performed were:

* Big Data Analysis: using HPC, Linux, and bash, I analyzed the 16S rRNA information of several samples
* Creation of plots: using R, Rstudio, Excel, and Python
* Software development: I developed several tools for ETL data using bash, python, and Perl
* Creation of paper: with the data obtained from this internship, I co-authored this paper

As a part-time teacher, I taught middle and high school students math classes to increase their grades or for college admission tests.

* Prepared group and individualized classes and lessons
* Applied weekly assessments to each student
