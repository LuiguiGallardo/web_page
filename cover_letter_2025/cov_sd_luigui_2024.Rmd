My name is Luigui, and I am writing to apply for the Junior Back End Engineer position at Minware. I believe my educational background and work experience make me a strong candidate for this role.

I have a solid foundation in software engineering, with experience in designing, developing, and maintaining back-end applications. My previous roles, including as a Graduate Research Assistant and Data Engineer, have equipped me with the skills needed to build scalable and maintainable systems, manage technical debt, and contribute effectively to cross-functional teams.

I am particularly excited about the opportunity to work directly with minwareâ€™s founders to build a product from the ground up. I thrive in environments where I can apply my problem-solving skills and focus on process efficiency and code quality. I am confident that my experience with technologies like PostgreSQL, Next.js, and GraphQL, along with my familiarity with AWS and Terraform, will allow me to contribute meaningfully to your team.

I have attached my CV and invite you to visit my personal website at https://www.lmgb.xyz, where you can find more details about my projects and experience.

I am eager to bring my expertise to Minwarew and look forward to the possibility of discussing how I can contribute to your team.
