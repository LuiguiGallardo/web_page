I am writing to express my strong interest in the Research Technician - Genomics Core Facility position at Scripps Research. My background in bioinformatics, programming, and data analysis, coupled with a keen interest in drug discovery, aligns perfectly with the strategic goals of Scripps Research. During my doctorate at the Institute of Biotechnology (UNAM), I played a pivotal role in extracting insights from biological datasets. My work with Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies significantly contributed to high-impact publications, as highlighted in my portfolio: https://luiguigallardo.github.io/web_page/.

I am particularly drawn to Scripps Research's groundbreaking work in cancer biology, immunology, neuroscience, and infectious diseases. Your innovative research in these areas, especially the application of genomics and bioinformatics to understand disease mechanisms and develop novel therapeutics, aligns perfectly with my interests and expertise.I am a highly motivated and adaptable team player, passionate about working at the intersection of bioinformatics and drug development. I am eager to contribute my skills and collaborate with Scripps's multidisciplinary teams to advance the discovery of transformative medicines.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience can contribute to Scripps Research's mission to develop life-changing treatments.
